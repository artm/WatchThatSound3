WatchThatSound3
===============

This is a work in progress refactoring of the [WatchThatSound][WTS]-3.0 with accent on acceptance testing 
and software modularity.

One of the componets - [bioscope][bios] - used to have its own project, but is now integrated into this 
source tree.

What is missing from the source tree are QtCreator project customizations used to run the tests. **TODO:** 
*screenshots of project preferences from snigel?* With the setup I had I could concentrate on a module
and just run its test suite after each modification. Once in a while I would run the full test suite to
see if the integration broke.
